    <h3>
      Hello, I'm Chuong Le, a full-stack developer and bridge system engineer from Vietnam, currently living and working in Japan. With over 3 years of experience as a BrSE, I act as a vital bridge between Japanese clients and Vietnamese development teams — translating ideas, aligning expectations, and ensuring smooth project execution across borders.
      I’m passionate about crafting digital solutions that are both technically sound and aligned with real-world business needs. I find joy in problem-solving, communication, and the collaborative nature of software development.
      Outside of work, I live simply and appreciate the calm rhythm of life. I enjoy the peaceful countryside, where I feel most at home — surrounded by nature, away from the bustle of the city. I also love watching sports and believe in continuous self-growth, embracing each challenge as an opportunity to learn and improve.
    </h3>
